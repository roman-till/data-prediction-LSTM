About my approach:
-	Time series prediction for data prediction, as it fits the job
-	Using PyTorch and a Long Short Term Memory Network
-	Implementation in Jupyter Notebook
About the data set:
-	Monthly PV yields from my brother's PV system
-	Monthly data from 2014 - 2020 (84 months in total)
About the data prediction:
-	Data prediction of the last 12 months in relation to the 72 months before.

It was important to me to present a simple code that is easy to follow without too much "boiler plate code" and losing sight of the essentials.
